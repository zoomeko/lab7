## Java Lab 7, Objects, Classes and Inheritance

### ITEC Insects, HVAC, Support Tickets

Instructions:

Finish the programs as described in the instructions. 

Run and test your code to make sure it works. 
Also run the tests and make sure the autograder will think it works too.

When done, commit and push your code to your own GitHub repository. 
The autograder will check your code after the lab deadline.  

I will also check your code. The autograder can't check every aspect of your program, it just makes sure that it basically seems to work.  Even if all of your tests pass, you may not get full marks on the lab - if your code is not commented, badly written, has bugs that the autograder isn't checking for... If you would like me to review your code before you turn it in, I'll be happy to do so! I'd like to help you improve the quality of your code (and improve your grades too!)  So just ask.

If any of the tests fail and you are sure your code is right, please tell me ASAP! 
These labs new and there may be bugs in the tests. Your help is appreciated.

Any questions? Need help? Please contact me. I'm here to help.
